        <p>Your life is made up of years,
                your years are made up of months,

                and your weeks are made up of days.
                If you get your days right, everything 
                else falls into place. And how do you 
                get your days right? By planning your

        <p>Keep in mind that even if you plan your day 
            it’s highly unlikely that everything will go 
            exactly as planned. However, your odds of 
            having a good day will be much higher with a 
            perfect day plan than if you just let things 
            happen and allow other people to run your day.</p>
        <h3>Review Your Results</h3>
        <p>After a week of planning your perfect day, 
            go over how things are going. Review how 
            successful you’re being in sticking to your 
            perfect day plan by asking yourself questions 
            like the ones you’ll find below:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Are your days going as planned?</li>
            <li>If not, why not? Who or what keeps getting 
                in the way?</li>
            <li>What do you need to do so that you can better 
                adhere to your perfect day plan?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>How you spend your days will determine 
            what your life will be like.  Live your 
            best life by planning your perfect day. 
            Then, make sure that you get to work on 
            following your plan.</p>
